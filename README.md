# AI Personal Trainer

## Overview
The AI Persional Trainer is a Python program that utilizes the [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/) library to detect and analyze body poses from a live video stream. It incorporates a trained machine learning model to recognize specific movements, such as "up" and "down," and keeps track of repetitions.

## Features
- Real-time body pose detection using the MediaPipe Pose model.
- Integration with a pre-trained machine learning model (`deadlift.pkl`) for movement classification.
- Counter for tracking the number of repetitions.
- GUI display using IPython widgets in a Jupyter/Colab notebook environment.

## Prerequisites
Before running the program, make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install ipywidgets mediapipe pandas opencv-python-headless Pillow
```

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed as mentioned in the "Prerequisites" section.
2. Run the provided notebook or script in your Jupyter/Colab environment.

## Files
- `Swoleboi_Pose_Detector.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the Swoleboi Pose Detector code.
- `landmarks.py`: File containing the definition of landmarks used in the pose detection.
- `deadlift.pkl`: Pre-trained machine learning model for movement classification.
